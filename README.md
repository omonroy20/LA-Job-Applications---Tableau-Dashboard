# LA-Job-Applications---Tableau-Dashboard

Back at it again with the Tableau stuff. I just wanted to showcase my ability to create a dashboard using a dataset I found on Kaggle. The dataset revolved around
job applicants between 2013-2015 in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the dataset didn't prove to be too interesting so I just opted for a simplistic dashboard
featuring metadata based on the applicants' demographics. Nothimg too interesting. Should also be noted that my laptop is 720p, so everything looked cramped
to me when I was creating the dashboard. Oh well. Have fun looking at this dashboard I crafted in 20 minutes.
